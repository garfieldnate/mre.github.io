Recently I read an article titled ["What Happened In The 2010s"](https://avc.com/2019/12/what-happened-in-the-2010s/) by Fred Wilson.
It is covering quite a wide variety of topics like tech, startups, and business.
This inspired me to share my view on a much smaller topic: **What happened in Software Engineering in the last decade?**

## Where do we even start?

From a bird's eye view, programming computers is still the same as in 2009:
you write a program, feed it to the computer and get some output.
But if we look a little closer, a lot has changed in this decade. _Everything_ has changed to be precise.

In 2009, I still wrote [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugins, ran a few websites on shared hosting services and uploaded content via FTP.
Version control was done with SVN &mdash; if at all.
Code was copy-and-pasted from dubious forums, other websites, or hand-transcribed from books.
StackOverflow was still a novelty.

## Explosion of new programming languages

The last decade saw a big number of new and exciting programming languages:
Go, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Rust, Typescript, Julia, Elixir, Elm, Crystal, Nim to name a few.

**ALL** of the above are developed in the open and the source code is on Github. That means, everyone can participate in their development.
Open Source is the default now.

Each of those languages brought something new to the table, that made them popular.

Go: Simple concurrency, fast, awesome tooling, simple code
Kotlin


## Old Dogs learn new tricks

But the older languages also did not stand still!

C++11 pushed the language into a new era.
Lambdas, `auto` pointers, range-based loops, and more were added to the language.

Most languages adopted a quicker release cycle.
Here's a list of popular languages:

| Language                | Release cycle |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Java                    | 6 months      |
| C                       | irregular     |
| Python                  | 12 months     |
| C++                     | ~ 3 years     |
| C#                      | ~ 12 months   |
| Visual Basic .NET       | ~ 24 months   |
| JavaScript (Ecmascript) | 12 months     |
| PHP                     | 12 months     |
| Swift                   | 6 months      |
| Ruby                    | 12 months     |
| Go                      | 6 months      |

At the beginning of the last decade, the latest PHP version was 5.3.
We are at 7.4 now. (We actually skipped 6.0. Let's not talk about it.)
Along the way it got 100% faster. It's a truly modern programming language now, with a thriving ecosystem.

Even Visual Basic has <<FEATURE>> now.

## Death of Null

Mainstream languages finally adopted safer alternatives to `null`: nullable types, option, result types

## Revival of type systems

Type systems were eschewed in the early 2000s.

Typescript
Python types
PHP types

It goes in both directions, though.
Java, C++, and Rust have type inference.

## Explosion of frameworks

Angular (2010)
React (2013)
Vue (2014)
Svelte (2016)

## Explosion of ecosystem packages

NPM
crates.io
PyPi

## Modern ways to run our programs

- Vagrant 2010
- Docker 2013
- Kubernetes 2014
- WebAssembly
- Serverless

- Spanner https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-reveals-spanner-the-database-tech-that-can-span-the-planet/

Atom (2014) and Visual Studio Code (2015)

[Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) in 2012

## Unbelievable twists of fate

Weird, unexpected things:
Microsoft is a cool company now, aquires Github
[open sources .NET](https://news.microsoft.com/2014/11/12/microsoft-takes-net-open-source-and-cross-platform-adds-new-development-capabilities-with-visual-studio-2015-net-2015-and-visual-studio-online/)
Windows subsystem for Linux https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux

[IBM aquires Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-ibm-creating-leading-hybrid-cloud-provider)

.Net is open source
Machine Learning
GPUs
Ubiquitous Compute
Async Everywhere
Parallel execution methods
Fibers
Channels
Coroutines became mainstream
Cloud Computing

## New chances

Crypto Currencies
Garbage collection optional

## New threads

New threads like [Spectre](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html) and [Meltdown](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16065845)
[Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/)
Ransomware

Software eats the world &mdash; and the speed is ever accelerating.
