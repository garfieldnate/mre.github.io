I'm Matthias Endler, a Backend Engineer living in Düsseldorf, Germany.
My interests are scalability, performance and distributed systems.

I have an M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universität Bayreuth].\
At work, I improve the Backend infrastructure of [trivago] by making it
faster and more reliable.

Nowadays, I mostly use *Golang*, *Python*, and *Rust* to get stuff done.
I run [*Hello, Rust!*], a YouTube channel about the Rust programming
language.

I\'m an active member of the following usergroups:

- [Rust Cologne]
- [Web Engineering Düsseldorf]
- [Python Meeting Düsseldorf (PyDDF)]

Here's a list of [previous Talks][talks] I gave there and elsewhere.  

At home I feel like riding my motorcycle, playing guitar in Rock bands
and drinking hot chocolate. (In that order.)

You can find me on [Twitter], [LinkedIn], [Stack Overflow], and [Github] or send me a [mail].
