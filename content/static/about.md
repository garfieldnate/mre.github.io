![Matthias Endler profile photo](/matthias.jpg)

I'm a Backend Developer / Site Reliability Engineer living in Düsseldorf, Germany.

My interests are scalability, performance and distributed systems;
but I also play around with embedded systems and console emulation.
I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universität Bayreuth].\
At work, I improve the Backend infrastructure of [trivago] by making it
faster and more reliable.

Nowadays, I mostly use _Golang_, _Python_, and _Rust_ to get stuff done.
I run [*Hello, Rust!*], a YouTube channel about the Rust programming
language.

I\'m an active member of the following usergroups:

- [Rust Cologne]
- [Web Engineering Düsseldorf]
- [Python Meeting Düsseldorf (PyDDF)]

You can find me on [Twitter], [LinkedIn], [Stack Overflow], and [Github] or send me an [e-mail].

Oh yeah, and I also [give talks][talks]. Let me know if you need a speaker.
